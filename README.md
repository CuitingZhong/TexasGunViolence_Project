# TexasGunViolence_Project

## Introduction
Every day, about 30 people die in gun homicides in the U.S. Another 200 are injured by bullets. These incidents of gun violence are recorded in every corner of the country. Thanks to the Gun Violence Archive, data on gun homicides and nonfatal shootings is available for us.

## Project Goal
We are investigating Gun Violence Data (over 260k US gun violence incidents from 2013-2018) but focusing only on relevant data of Texas State. We adopt exploratory analysis to interpret the data from different perspectives. We try to find out the trend of this incident and make a forecast of how gun violence can increase or decrease in the future.
